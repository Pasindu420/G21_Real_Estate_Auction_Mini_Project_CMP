The objective of this assignment is to provide some hands-on experience on client-server programming using sockets and TCP/IP protocol suite in a distributed environment.
We consider a simple distributed application consisting of an Auction Server (AS), a seller
and multiple buyer processes. The seller and buyers will connect to Auction Server to perform
transactions on individual items. You will write the auction server and client (seller and buyer)
programs using TCP as the transport layer protocol.

Please review project3.pdf for specifications and instructions on how to use system.
